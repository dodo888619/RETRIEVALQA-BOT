The irony, though, is that her moniker is an acronym for Having Everything Revealed."[13] Wilson's follow-up EP, H.E.R. Vol. 2 (2017) also produced by Harris, was released on June 16, 2017, and includes the single "Say It Again".

I feel like oftentimes we don't like to be open as people about our emotions or things that we are going through. At the time [of recording], I was very closed off except for when I was writing or when I was in the studio."[28] She explained further: "I am a voice for women who feel like they're alone in these situations. This project came from emotion, and that's what I want it to be about – not what I look like or who I'm with, but the raw emotion and support for women."[29] To NPR she said, "I feel like this is the era of the anti- star. I really just wanted it to be about the music, and get away from, 'Who is she with?' and 'What is she wearing?' "[30] H.E.R. appeared as herself in the movie Yes Day (2021).[31] She performed her original song "Change" on the episode "Active Citizenship" of the 2021 Netflix educational animated series We the People.[32] On July 20, 2022, it was announced that H.E.R. would be singing the role of Belle for ABC's Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration.[33] The television special aired on December 15, 2022.
